Th entire UX / UI strategy I went for was a minimal design with heavy use of white-space on large viewports which shrinks as the viewport gets smaller.

- I started out with some sketches on paper just to get a rough idea of the basic layout of the page.

- I then took to Fireworks to build a mockup of the page. This mockup let me experient with different white-space, font faces, sizes, colours and general positioning to ensure I didn't spend the coding phase still doing design. The mockup attached includes a custom logo and icons but these were added after the design was implemented.

- Before implementing the design, I made sure I had Firefox, Chrome and IE6 available for quick-testing. Safari was a problem as Apple stopped supporting the Windows build a couple of years ago. However, as Safari also uses webkit for rendering I did not consider this a huge problem and knew I could text it in a virtual platform afterwards.

- Before beginning, I knew I would probably need Javascript at some point to work-around old browser rendering issues, although, I wanted to minimise my use of JS as much as possible due to it impacting load times and causing issues on non-JS or minimal-JS platforms such as some mobile browsers. Surprisingly, I always managed to find a CSS-only solution which means the whole page is JS-free! The only exception is the single, inline IE expression used to set the max-width of the layout as IE6  doesn't support max-width.

- After a lot of battling with IE6 I eventually managed to get the whole page responsive with all browsers on all platforms without any real loss of appearance or functionality anywhere. I found I didn't even need to use media-queries in the end as the default viewport scaling didn't seem to degrade overall appearance at all. There was some white-space above and below the feature images when viewed in a very small viewport, although, I felt that moving the images above or below the feature text might make the page too 'scrolly'. Perhaps a better solution would have been to remove the images completely from a very small viewport.

- When I finished and was happy with the outcome I spent a while making some custom feature images and a logo just for fun. I added some CSS3 text-shadows on some of the text and gave the buy button at the bottom an animated hover effect.

- It said in the spec: "It must also be clear for each type of user (existing and new) how they can buy the product".
I thought about this and came to the conclusion that the button to buy Tune-ify should be the same button for both existing and new customers and that new customers would simply be redirected to a Vasanta account creation page prior to the purchase procedure actually taking place. This would mostly be handled server-side and would check to see if the viewer is actually logged into a Vasanta account or not.

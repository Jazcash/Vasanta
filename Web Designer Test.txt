Web Designer Brief

Task
Build a working prototype of a landing page, that could be used for user testing sessions /  to gain feedback on the UX & UI. 

Detailed overview
Vasanta are introducing a new product ‘Tune-ify’ for a new digital product range. The add-on prioritises streaming music and video traffic and provides users with a media streaming service and 60Gb of online shared media storage. The intention is for this to be used as a media repository allowing the user to stream their personal music collection to any Internet connected device (e.g. PC, TV, mobile phone, tablet, car audio player). 

The product features are:

•	Prioritisation of all streaming media traffic
•	Personal media streaming server solution
•	60GB of online storage space 
•	User’s can pay for extra storage at £1 extra per 5GB
•	Secure access controls
•	Parental controls

The add-on is available to all Vasanta customers new and existing, costing
£5 a month extra.

It must also be clear for each type of user (existing and new) how they can buy the product.

Build Spec
Using any of the supplied assets and creating any other new assets you deem suitable, you should build the page to be cross-browser compatible with the following browsers:

IE6 –10
Firefox (latest version) v36
Google Chrome (latest version)
Safari (latest version)

Feel free to use CSS3 features and a JavaScript library of your choice and comment code to explain browser workarounds where appropriate. 

Keep in mind this should make the use of responsive design for this build where possible and render correct for small-form/mobile/tablet devices.

Please note:
You should spend no longer than 6 hours in total on this task. We’re not looking for a polished design (however you can polish if you wish to), just a rough concept, but with attention to the build.
